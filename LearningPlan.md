## AI
### [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
This course has been designed for experienced devs. Should not require that much of our time and is interactive not video based.

### Math
[Essential Math for ML Python Ed.](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/essential-math-for-machine-learning-python-edition/)
This course is video based but short. The idea here is that this free resource is a place to go to figure out what we don't know and identify the things we need to really lock down on eventually through Khan academy via targeted learning. Also it helps us understand how to implement the need math in python.

### ML
These are all kaggle courses and I like that they are not video based and interactive.

### Deep Learning
Our goal is to learn and implement a deep reinforcement learning model. OpenAi is the leader in this area from the best of my knowledge They've standardized on Py Torch as their framework of choice. by building on the prior lesson I think this should be sufficient to make us comfortable with the tool.

### Reinforcement Learning
This is our meat and potatoes. Eventually we'll have to move the model we create over to tensorflow in order to use it on the web or in an iot situation as the infrastructure for doing so with tensorflow is just better for production. But we've got to learn and do everything step by step. 

### Tensorflow
We'll go back to learning about Deep Learning with a focus on Tensorflow. Next we'll learn how to bring it all together by following the example in a blog post that combines the OpenAI Gym with Tensorflow 2. Then we'll learn about tensorflow.js so we can implement the cartpole in js.


### SQL
Time to finally learn this. It's on Kaggle so it shouldn't be to time consuming.
